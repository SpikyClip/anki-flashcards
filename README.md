# Anki Flashcards
### *Vikesh Ajith*

This is a collection of Anki flashcards I've made over the years for university and general topics. The older cards are slightly outdated style-wise as I've learnt a few tricks over the years, and it would take some effort to go back and update them as the old styles are a bit hard-coded. These flashcards require the application [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and were last tested on version 2.1.4. The collection package contains the current flashcards I've been working on lately.
